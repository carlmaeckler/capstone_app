# capstone_app



This is the streamlit application we built for our capstone project in the buiness analytics course at the university of st gallen.

The app helps you to decide which rider should be the team leader of your team. Based on previous results you can check how the individual riders perform on certain stages or on the full course. Furthermore you can compare riders predicted performance on the stages.
